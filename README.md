# renderjack

Renderjack is currently a WIP software rasterization engine with the intent of being OpenGL compliant.
While technically shading language agnostic, it is designed alongside and intended to be used with [Motoki](https://github.com/Nyrox/motokigo) and used as a render-daemon for [Moto-Forestry](https://github.com/Nyrox/moto-forestry).
